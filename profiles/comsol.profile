    Mesh

mesh elements:
mesh high-order mapping: Any? [[https://www.comsol.com/blogs/keeping-track-of-element-order-in-multiphysics-models/][ Second-order is the default for most cases.]]
mesh generation: Built-in
mesh input\output:
mesh adaptive-refinement: generate new mesh with variable density, no(?) p-refinement.
automatic mesh partitioning:
CAD files support: STEP, IGES and [[https://www.comsol.com/cad-import-module][many others]].


    Parallel possibilities

MPI: Almost ideal for parameter sweep? For large scale simulations  Comsol 4.2 [[https://www.comsol.ru/paper/download/83777/pepper_presentation.pdf][bench by Pepper]] has 19.2 speedup on 24 core cluster (0.8 efficiency).
